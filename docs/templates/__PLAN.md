I want 	


I want my app to be robust and handle exceptions at runtime with good user experience
I want my app to read, insert and rely on clean and exactly matched data per company
I want my app to be scalable, performant and resilient
I want my app to have beautiful and modern UI for great user experience 
I want my app to be modular and follow API contracts between DB, python and the frontend so I can switch frameworks easily later on


Review the project starting with README.md and the files in docs/standards. When needed during the check, see exact files


Key considerations:
- …
- …
- 


Create a plan in docs/standards

make into separate, consequtive, fresh sessions with ai agents
add mentions and references of README.md to ensure context and robustness of the plan
consider intermediete instructions and steps to ensure robust plan execution and context handling between fresh agent sessions
If needed keep notes in folder tmp and let all agents from different session use the notes. I will not verify anything between sessions. I will do one final commit and manual run of all pytests at the end
make separate file with ready copy paste instructions per session to feed to the agent. make the file name the same as the plan with extra index _agent_instructions
At he end, ensure clean code and structure. No dead or unused code is left. No temp files. If needed add steps and checks per session
