Each of the Reporting Persons disclaims beneficial ownership of the securities held by the other Reporting Persons, and this report shall not be deemed to be an admission that any such person is the beneficial owner of such securities.

this Secured Margin Line of Credit Note (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with
its terms, the &ldquo;Note&rdquo;), up to an aggregate principal amount of up to One Hundred Million Dollars and Zero Cents ($100,000,000.00),
or such other Line Amount as set forth in the most recent Statement of Key Margin Line of Credit Terms issued by the Bank in connection
with this Note (the &ldquo;Margin Loan Terms Statement&rdquo;), on the Maturity Date (as defined below) of each such Margin Loan, together

be used as defined in the Margin Loan Terms Statement. The Margin Loan Terms Statement is incorporated by reference into this Note.</P>

margin line of credit evidenced by this Note (the &ldquo;Margin Line of Credit&rdquo;) and this Note does not create any contractual or
other commitment to lend by the Bank. Any Margin Loan made by the Bank hereunder matures on its applicable Maturity Date and the Bank

in the event that Short-Term Fixed Margin Loans are an available Margin Loan Type and/or there is more than one Base Rate available for
Variable Margin Loans. The initial Margin Loan made under this Note must be in an amount at least equal to the Minimum Initial Margin
Loan Amount. A Short-Term Fixed Margin Loan, if made, must be in an amount at least equal to the Short-Term Fixed Margin Loan Minimum
Amount. If there is more than one Base Rate set forth in the Margin Loan Terms Statement, then the Base Rate applicable to each Margin
Loan shall be selected by the Borrower from the options set forth in the Margin Loan Terms Statement. Each Margin Loan, if made, shall
bear interest at the Interest Rate identified in the Margin Loan Terms Statement. If a Base Rate becomes temporarily or permanently unavailable,
it will be replaced in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;6.</P>

any time can change the eligibility of the securities and other assets in your account for purposes of determining collateral value and
can, as set forth in your margin loan documentation, increase or decrease the value assigned to the securities and other assets, and is
not required to provide you advance notice. These changes in the collateral value often take effect immediately and could result in a
collateral shortfall. Your failure to cure the collateral shortfall by either providing additional collateral or paying down the margin
loan(s)&nbsp;may cause the Bank to liquidate or sell securities or other assets in your account.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

<P STYLE="text-align: justify; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Before entering into a margin loan or margin line of credit facility,
you should carefully review the margin loan and collateral documents provided to you by the Bank, and consult the Bank regarding any questions
or concerns you may have about the margin loan or margin line of credit.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: justify; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">If the margin loan(s)&nbsp;is/are subject to a floating interest rate
option, you should consider that changes in interest rates can lead to a higher or lower cost of borrowing for you. Increases in interest
rates can increase the cost of borrowing, which will negatively impact the economics of the margin loan(s).</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: justify; font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">Before entering into a margin loan or margin line of credit facility,
you should consider alternatives such as using available cash or proceeds from the sale of securities or other assets. In addition, you
should consider, among other things, your investment objectives and risk tolerance, the interest costs of borrowing against your account,
fees and charges for selling assets, the tax consequences of selling assets or borrowing, and the loss of potential appreciation on any
assets sold. It is important to note that the Bank and its affiliates may earn more if you borrow against your securities and other assets
rather than liquidate assets to meet your cash needs.</P>

you. Increases in interest rates can increase the cost of borrowing, which will negatively impact the economics of the margin loan(s).</P>

of credit facility, you should consider alternatives such as using available cash or proceeds from the sale of securities or other assets.
In addition, you should consider, among other things, your investment objectives and risk tolerance, the interest costs of borrowing against
your account, fees and charges for selling assets, the tax consequences of selling assets or borrowing, and the loss of potential appreciation
on any assets sold. It is important to note that the Bank and its affiliates may earn more if you borrow against your securities and other
assets rather than liquidate assets to meet your cash needs.</P>
